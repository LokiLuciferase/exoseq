# nf-core/ExoSeq: AWS Configuration

We currently do not have tested the nfcore/ExoSeq pipeline on AWS. Theoretically, the worfklow should work in a similar fashion to [NGI-RNASeq](https://github.com/nf-core/RNAseq/blob/master/docs/configuration/aws.md). Further information on NextFlow support for AWS can be found in the (NextFlow documentation)[https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/awscloud.html].
