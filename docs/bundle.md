Bundle files
============

GATK v3.X relies on bundle files coming that are recommended. We follow the guidelines here strictly, as incorporating other sources such as ExAC, GnomAD or similar can be used for annotation but not for calibrating variants according to guidelines at the Broad Institute.

Download the bundle data here to your local infrastructure:

In case you are using Google Cloud, you may also access the storage bucket directly as listed on the webpage. Similar for Amazon AWS.
